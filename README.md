The fastest way to build and share data apps.

Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into sharable web apps in minutes, not weeks. It's all Python, open-source, and free! And once you've created an app you can use our free sharing platform to deploy, manage, and share your app with the world.

Example of live coding an app in Streamlit|635x380

Installation
pip install streamlit
streamlit hello
Streamlit can also be installed in a virtual environment on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

A little example
Streamlit makes it incredibly easy to build interactive apps:

import streamlit as st

x = st.slider('Select a value')
st.write(x, 'squared is', x * x)


A bigger example
Streamlit's simple and focused API lets you build incredibly rich and powerful tools.  This demo project lets you browse the entire Udacity self-driving-car dataset and run inference in real-time using the YOLO object detection net.

Final App Animation

The complete demo is implemented in less than 300 lines of Python. In fact, the app contains only 23 Streamlit calls which illustrates all the major building blocks of Streamlit. You can try it right now at share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-self-driving.

The Streamlit GitHub badge
Streamlit's GitHub badge helps others find and play with your Streamlit app.
